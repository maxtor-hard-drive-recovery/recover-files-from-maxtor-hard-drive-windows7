One situation is that you may [format hard drive on Windows 7](http://www.icare-recovery.com/windows-7-recovery/windows-7-format-recovery.html) by chance, while the other situation is that you may format Maxtor hard drive due to certain reasons such as you get disk partition not formatted error message on Windows 7, Windows 7 is infected with virus or hard drive has bad sectors and more other reasons. For all data loss situations mentioned here, iCare Data Recovery is able to restore the lost files with ease.\r\n\r\n### Is Data Recoverable When Formatting Maxtor Hard Disk due to Disk Error?\r\nWhen your [Maxtor hard disk is formatted due to human mistake](http://www.icare-recovery.com/faq/accidentally-formatted-drive.html), it only removes files from the hard disk. However, when a hard disk shows disk error like hard disk not formatted error, the files may be corrupted. If you format the hard disk in this situation, can you still recover the lost files? In fact, files are still recoverable with iCare Data Recovery. You just need to run \"Deep Scan Recovery\" module to search for and recover the lost files.\r\n\r\n**Note**: When a hard disk has not formatted error or other kinds of errors, we often recommend you to recover files from the hard disk first of all and then format the hard disk because the data is at a risk of being overwritten if you mistakenly write some new data to the hard disk after formatting.\r\n\r\n### Undelete Files from Maxtor Hard Drive in Windows 7\r\nAnother main reason for Maxtor hard disk data loss might be deletion of files. You may delete some files mistakenly from the disk partition, or even worse, you [delete the partition](http://www.icare-recovery.com/windows-7-recovery/windows-7-deleted-partition-recovery.html) without backup data. In order to recover as more data as possible after deleting, you should always remember not to write new data to a Maxtor disk partition where files were deleted. By using iCare Data Recovery, it is possible to restore almost all deleted files on condition that they are not overwritten.\r\n\r\n### Related Articles\r\n[Free download iCare Data Recovery for format recovery](http://icare-format-recovery.soft112.com/)\r\n\r\n[Convert sd memory card from raw to fat32](http://freeware-fix.blogspot.com/2013/05/raw-sd-card-to-fat32.html‎)\r\n\r\n[Recover files after formatting memory card](http://blog4mark.blogspot.com/2013/01/unformat-memory-card.html‎)\r\n\r\n[Windows 7 deleted partition recovery software free download](https://www.rebelmouse.com/deletedfilerecovery/recover-deleted-file-windows-7-464729225.html)\r\n\r\n[Samsung hard drive cannot be recognized by Windows 7 operating systm](http://samsungharddiskrecovery.wordpress.com/2014/03/10/windows7-cannot-detect-samsung-hard-disk/)\r\n\r\n[Format recovery software for windows 7](http://youtu.be/INwHzh-DmiA)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
